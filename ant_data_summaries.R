#' Get ant species presence/absence by year (and plot if desired) from colony census data
#'
#' Anomalies in ant colony census protocol over the years means that it can be difficult to discern true absences
#' of all species in all years.  This function uses information from Portal_ant_species.csv and Portal_ant_dataflags.csv
#' to predict true presence/absence of species per plot per year.  If a more conservative estimate is desired, 
#' setting the argument 'rare_sp = T' will only include species we are confident were censused regularly. Setting
#' 'rare_sp = F' may include some false absences, since it is unknown if some rare species were censused in all years.
#' Unknowns are always xcluded, as well as extremely rare species (if a species is only recorded a few times in one year of 30, 
#' it was assumed that data for this species was not collected consistently through time)
#'
#' @param level 'Site' or 'Plot'
#' @param rare_sp include rare species (T) or not (F). 
#'                    Rare species may or may not have been censused in all years. Setting rare_sp=F gives a more conservative estimate of presence/absence
#'                    
#' @return data frame with year, species, (plot if applicable), and presence [1,0,NA]
